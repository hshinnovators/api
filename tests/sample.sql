As a result, thousands of scientists worldwide involved in this and related research areas end up manually counting cells themselves. This could, for an average scientist, take anything from 10-20% of their time on a yearly basis. \n\nNot only this is a waste of time and resources, it is potentially dangerous for Science as in most cases the scientist testing a treatment is the one that directly evaluates its performance. With many cells in an intermediary, difficult to classify state, biases inevitably appear and scientific results are questioned and retracted.\n\nWe want to investigate other ways of dealing with this time-consuming task, including the possibility of opening a collaborative project online, similar to the Galaxy Zoo, with [www.zooniverse.org](http://www.zooniverse.org) and request volunteers to help counting parts of images, then adding up results (after some quality checks) and offering an accurate answer, very much in the way [www.cellslider.net](http://www.cellslider.net) does with cancer cells. \n\nWe also want to evaluate the economic viability of using services such as those provided by Amazon Turk [www.mturk.com](http://www.mturk.com) and others and see if there is a possibility for a viable business model. \n\nAs this is a problem affecting thousands of researchers around the world, it may well be possible to develop a commercial product around this service, if we conclude it can be offered at reasonable prices. There is also a market for the revision of published supporting materials, to double check that results are free from bias, detect manipulations and minimise academic retractions.\n\nCounting an image can require up to 15 minutes of a researcher’s time, and this is a task that needs to be done in the thousands every year. We think we should help to ease this procedure until image processing improves to the point it can be accurately performed by an algorithm.\n\nWe require the students to work in setting up a zooniverse project, and create thousands of tasks for the mTurk derived from Dr. Rossman\'s materials, and see how people reacts to this proposition of helping science for free, how accurate and consistent are their results, and to compare these with the cost and accuracy of the mTurk. \n\nThe students will also create a series of webpages and introductory videos as tutorials to quickly describe the tasks at hand and provide both volunteers and turkers with help, recommendations and examples to improve their contribution.\n\nIf the project is successful we may find a new, cheaper method to semi-automate this critical but tedious error prone task, reducing its bias and easing top researchers from this menial task. \n\nIn the process we will explore the possibility of basing a new CAPTCHA in the difficulty of the task at hand, having an impact on both Biology and Security. \n\nWe aim to publish results in an Open Access Journal and launch this service commercially if results are positive. \n\nWe need a team of motivated students with knowledge or willingness to learn Python.'),
