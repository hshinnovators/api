# KentProjects API &raquo; Model Maps

Model Maps are clever classes to assist in the mapping of two models.

Since they are a little funny and have long class names, they have `_` in their class names but don't split into
multitudes of folders as they should. Instead, they will always relocate to here.

`GroupStudentMap` will translate to `/models/maps/groupstudentmap.php`, for example.
